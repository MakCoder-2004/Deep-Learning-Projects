# 🧠 Deep Learning Projects

Welcome to my **Deep Learning Projects** repository, a personal collection of implementations, experiments, and mini‑projects created to strengthen and expand my skills in modern neural network architectures and deep learning techniques.

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository documents my journey in learning and mastering **Deep Learning**. It contains hands‑on projects built using **Python**, **TensorFlow**, and other essential machine learning libraries. Each project focuses on applying theory to practice while exploring different types of neural networks and real‑world tasks.

## 🔍 What’s Inside

A growing set of implementations featuring:

* **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** – for image classification and computer vision
* **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** and **LSTMs** – for sequence and time‑series modeling
* **Transformers** – for NLP and attention‑based architectures
* Additional experiments and utility scripts related to deep learning

Every project includes elements such as:

* Data preprocessing and preparation
* Model architecture design and tuning
* Training workflows with callbacks and evaluation metrics
* Optional deployment or inference components
